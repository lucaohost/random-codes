You need install ffmpeg on your linux, before running the script.  
  
Explaining the command:  

-i '2024-10-16 13-44-08.mkv': Specifies the input video file, in this case, 2024-10-16 13-44-08.mkv.
-vf "setpts=PTS/1.33": This applies a video filter (-vf) to adjust the playback speed of the video. The setpts filter manipulates the Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) of the video. Dividing PTS by 1.33 speeds up the video by 33%.
-af "atempo=1.33, volume=5": This applies an audio filter (-af) to modify the audio:
atempo=1.33: Speeds up the audio by 33%, matching the video speed-up. The atempo filter can only handle values between 0.5 and 2.0, so this falls within the valid range.
volume=5: Increases the audio volume by 5 times the original level

PS: It's important increase the video and audio at the same time, otherwise it will break the video.
