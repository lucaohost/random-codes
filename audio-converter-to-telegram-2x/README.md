Telegram has certain limitations when it comes to playing audio files at different speeds. Specifically, the ability to change playback speed (e.g., 1.5x, 2x) is typically available only for voice messages

Metadata Differences: Voice messages usually have specific metadata that identifies them as messages, allowing Telegram's player to offer speed controls. Regular .ogg files lack this metadata, so Telegram treats them as standard audio without speed adjustment options.
